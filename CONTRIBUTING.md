Contributing Guide
==================

Thank you for considering contributing!

How to contribute
- Discuss changes via Issues first when in doubt.
- Fork the repo, create a feature branch, submit a PR.
- Keep PRs focused and small; add tests or manual steps when relevant.

Code style
- Follow existing patterns and keep changes minimal.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless necessary.

Security
- Do not include secrets in code or Git history.
- Report vulnerabilities privately as described in SECURITY.md.

Releases
- We use SemVer. Bump `__version__` in `client.py` for client changes.
